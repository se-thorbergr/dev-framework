# dev-framework ShellCheck configuration (tools/shell/shellcheckrc)
#
# Purpose
# - Keep shell script checks predictable across local runs and CI.
# - In `${MODE} == se` (Space Engineers mode), local tooling may skip running
#   ShellCheck; CI will still enforce checks.
#
# Format
# - One ShellCheck CLI flag per line.
# - Lines starting with `#` are comments.
# - These flags are merged with wrapper-provided defaults.
#
# Baseline settings (safe, conservative)
-s bash            # analyze scripts as Bash by default
-S style           # report style issues and above (info-level)
-x                 # follow 'source' to find referenced files (best-effort)

# Common project toggles (uncomment as needed)
# --external-sources   # allow non-local 'source' files (use with care)
# -e SC1090,SC1091     # suppress dynamic source path warnings if paths are resolved by wrappers
# -e SC2154            # suppress 'var is referenced but not assigned' when env injection is intentional
# -e SC2001            # if sed 's///' is intentional and alternative is noisy

# Notes
# - Tooling wrappers will respect `${MODE}` from core.yaml runtime_vars and may skip
#   ShellCheck locally in SE mode; CI runs the full check.
# - Keep disables minimal; prefer fixing scripts or teaching wrappers to resolve paths.
