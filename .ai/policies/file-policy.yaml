# .ai/policies/file-policy.yaml â€” read/write boundaries for agents
# Writes are limited to tracked/staged files; some paths excluded. Reads can include specific ignored artifacts.

writes:
  include:
    - tracked: true # git ls-files
    - staged: true # git diff --cached
  exclude:
    - "**/.ai/handoffs/**"
    - "**/.ai/matrices/**"

reads:
  allow:
    - "**/.ai/handoffs/**/*.md"
    - "**/.ai/matrices/**/*.{json,yml,yaml}"
notes:
  - "Treat .gitignore as the write/scan boundary; read-only exceptions above are allowed."
  - "Directory paths inside workflow command strings (e.g., Pester/bats roots like tools/tests/pwsh or tools/tests/bash) are allowed and exempt from filename mapping integrity checks."
