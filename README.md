## Goal

The idea is to provide a modular library for SE programming. Think of it like an Operating System that comes with libraries of basic functionality that can be used in all kinds of PB scripts - the programs running on the OS.

## Features

### Development Environment

- Windows
- Linux
- Powershell or Bash (Windows & Linux)
- Visual Studio Code (Windows & Linux)
- GPT Codex support (Codex cli or VSCode extension) for coding

## Git Super-Repo

The **dev-framework** is the **super-repo** providing the _development framework_ for creating Space Engineers Ingame Scripts using _Malware's Development Kit for SE_.

It includes:

- tools (project and CI helper tools)
  - Tools to scaffold new projects (wrappers to the MDK2 toolkit).
  - Tools to scaffold git submodules (for PBScript and Mixin projects)
  - Tools for GitHub CI workflows (Policy Gates)
- docs (policies, architecture, specs, guides, AI prompts)
- github CI (workflows / github actions)

The MDK2 Programmable Block Scripts and Mixins are not directly contained in this super-repo. Each part of the library and each script/program has its own project in separated submodules linked to the super-repo.

The Development Framework itself is responsible for the projects/submodules management, build process, CI workflow, etc. and enforcing the policies alignment.

## Important Note

This is a **hobby project**. That means I only work on it in my **_limited_ spare time**. So don't expect fast delivery of bugfixes and features.

As we are in a new era of _AI_ I decided to make heavily use of _GPT Codex_ to try out and learn what is possible. So you will find lots of **prompts** as part of the documentation.
