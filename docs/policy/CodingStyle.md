# Coding Style Policy

The following conventions apply across the dev-framework repository. Language-specific details will evolve with the project and should be updated alongside tooling and specs.

## Shared Requirements

- Include a descriptive header in scripts or source files referencing the project license when possible.
- Respect `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes`; update these files in tandem with policy changes.
- Keep autogenerated files clearly marked to avoid accidental edits.

## PowerShell

- Use PascalCase for cmdlet-style functions and parameters.
- Prefer advanced functions with `CmdletBinding` when non-trivial logic appears.
- Surface logging through the `--verbose`/`--notes-only` pipeline defined in [`SetupTooling`](../spec/tooling/SetupTooling.md) and related specs.

## Bash

- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- Keep scripts `set -euo pipefail` where practical; document intentional deviations.
- Mirror PowerShell CLI options when cross-platform tooling is provided.

## C# / MDKÂ² Artifacts

- Namespace and class names follow PascalCase; use partial classes for scaffolded stubs as described in [`ScaffoldMdk2Project`](../spec/tooling/ScaffoldMdk2Project.md).
- Avoid trailing whitespace and tabs (enforced via `.editorconfig`).

## Documentation

- Write in Markdown with 80-100 character soft limits.
- Include links back to the authoritative spec or policy when introducing new sections.

## Maintenance

- When codifying new style rules, update this policy, `.editorconfig`, and the relevant specs simultaneously.
- Record open style questions in `docs/TODO.md` or the appropriate spec _Open Questions_ section until resolved.
